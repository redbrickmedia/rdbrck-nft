# Redbrick NFT project

This is a repository containing the code for a NFT dAPP for the employees of Redbrick. The dAPP itself is hosted behind a portal so only employees with an organization address are able to access it.

### tl;dr

An employee recognition program that commends employees with digital assets based upon their tenure-ship at Redbrick.

### What is an NFT?

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Non-fungible means something that cannot be traded at the same value for another thing, due to its unique properties (ie. a piece of furniture, art, collectibles). Fungible means something where its value defines itself rather than its unique properties, like the US dollar.  NFTs can be associated with images, videos, audio files, and almost any other kind of stored information. They are non-interchangeable and immutable pieces of data stored on the blockchain.

### Why introduce them to an existing technology company? 

Each NFT is unique, and so is the work an employee does at their job. While there might be other people in the company doing the same _tasks_, 
the individual work can never be replaced because it's from _you_. The same thing goes for NFTs; the art might look similar, but they are inherently unique and can never be duplicated. 

What they represent is an employees time at the company and the work they did here, and the individual _legacy_ they leave behind.
